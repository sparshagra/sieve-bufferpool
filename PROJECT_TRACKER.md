## Project summary

A database **buffer pool manager** in C++17 (standard library only) with **five pluggable
eviction policies** — FIFO, LRU, CLOCK, SIEVE (NSDI'24), and S3-FIFO (SOSP'23) — benchmarked
against each other on synthetic access traces. Pages live in a simulated disk (a real file
addressed as fixed 4 KB pages), the pool holds N frames in one preallocated byte array, and a
hash-map page table maps `page_id -> frame index`. The metric that matters is **miss ratio**,
i.e. disk I/Os avoided; a separate `chrono` micro-benchmark reports **ops/sec** with disk I/O
disabled to isolate per-policy CPU overhead. The goal is to reproduce the papers' qualitative
claim — SIEVE and S3-FIFO beat LRU on Zipfian traces and resist scan pollution — with our own
numbers and charts.

## Decisions log

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Policies are header-only** (`include/policies/*.h`), no `src/policies/*.cpp` | Each policy is ~60–100 lines; a split .h/.cpp doubles the file count for no benefit. `src/policies/` is kept (empty) and globbed by CMake in case S3-FIFO outgrows a header. |
| D2 | **g++ one-liner is the primary build path; CMake is optional** | CMake is **not installed** on this machine. g++ 13.1.0 (MSYS2 UCRT64) is, at `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`. `CMakeLists.txt` is committed and correct, but the README leads with `build.ps1` / the raw g++ command. |
| D3 | **Pinning lives in the `EvictionPolicy` base class** as a preallocated `vector<uint8_t>` indexed by page_id | Every policy handles pinning identically (a pinned page is not a legal victim), so it is written once. Preallocating the full page-id space means `set_pinned` never allocates. |
| D4 | **Policies track `page_id` only** — never frames, never disk | Keeps the interface narrow (4 virtual methods) and makes the ops/sec micro-benchmark trivially fair: it measures policy bookkeeping and nothing else. |
| D5 | `page_id_t = int`, `INVALID_PAGE = -1` | `-1` doubles as the null link for the index-linked intrusive lists, so one sentinel covers both uses. |
| D6 | Prior abandoned **Python** scaffold moved to `_old_python_attempt/` rather than deleted | It was pure `NotImplementedError` stubs, superseded by the C++ plan. Delete it whenever; it is not referenced by anything. |
| D7 | `DiskManager::set_io_enabled(false)` makes I/O a counted no-op | Phase 4's ops/sec bench needs disk disabled; a flag on the existing class beats a second fake-disk type. |
| D8 | `gh` CLI not installed at end of Phase 0; GitHub push deferred until user installs it and runs `gh auth login` | Cannot create/push to a GitHub repo without it; global git identity (`sparshagra`) was already correctly configured, so local commits proceeded without waiting. Resolved: `gh` installed, authenticated as `sparshagra`, repo created and pushed at start of Phase 1. |
| D9 | FIFO/LRU internal lists use `std::unordered_map<page_id_t,int>` from page_id to node index, with a `capacity_`-sized (not `num_pages_`-sized) node array | Matches the master prompt's spec exactly and mirrors how `BufferPool`'s own page table works: node storage is bounded by how many pages can actually be resident, not by the whole page-id space, which is the realistic constraint for a real cache. |
| D10 | Hand-computed policy tests call `on_access`/`on_insert`/`evict()` directly on a bare policy via a small `simulate()` test helper, not through `BufferPool`/`DiskManager` | Isolates policy logic from disk I/O so the expected-eviction traces are exact and fast; `BufferPool`-level integration is covered separately by `bench/runner.cpp`. |
| D11 | CLOCK's new inserts start with `ref_bit = true` (one free pass); SIEVE's new inserts start with `visited = false` (no free pass) | Intentional and matches the papers: CLOCK protects freshly-loaded pages like most second-chance implementations (e.g. Postgres); SIEVE's "quick demotion" specifically depends on giving new objects *no* special protection so a one-hit-wonder ages out fast. |

## Git / GitHub workflow (effective Phase 1 onward)

- Repo was `git init`'d locally at the end of Phase 0; Phase 0's scaffold is committed as
  4 logical commits (scaffold/config, interfaces, disk manager + pool skeleton, stub runner/tests).
- Remote: public GitHub repo **`sieve-bufferpool`** under the user's account, created via `gh repo
  create` once `gh auth login` is done (blocked on `gh` CLI install as of end of Phase 0 —
  see Decisions log D8).
- **Every phase from Phase 1 onward ends with: build passes → tests pass → commit → push.**
  Never batch multiple phases into one commit; never push broken code; never `--force`;
  never fake/backdate commit timestamps.
- Each phase is split into **2–4 logical commits**, not one dump (e.g. Phase 2 →
  "Add CLOCK eviction policy" / "Add SIEVE eviction policy (NSDI'24)" /
  "Add hand-computed policy tests").
- Commit messages: short imperative subject line; a body line explaining **why** only when
  the reason isn't obvious from the diff (e.g. why SIEVE's hand persists across evictions).
- **Commit authorship is the user's alone** — global git identity is already set to
  `sparshagra <sparsh51@outlook.com>`; nothing in this repo's history should mention Claude,
  Anthropic, or any AI coding agent. Do not add Co-Authored-By trailers here.
- Python venv for `plot.py` (Phase 4) lives at `venv/` in the repo root, gitignored.

## Phase 2 — what exists now

- `include/policies/clock.h` — circular `std::vector<Slot>` of `capacity_` frames
  (occupied/ref_bit/page_id), `hand_` advances by `(hand_+1) % capacity_` every
  iteration regardless of outcome. New inserts get `ref_bit = true` (D11).
- `include/policies/sieve.h` — same list shape as FIFO/LRU (index-linked, head =
  newest / insert point, tail = oldest), plus a `visited` bit per node and a
  **persistent** `hand_` (`-1` sentinel means "wrap to `tail_` on next `evict()`",
  not "uninitialized every call"). New inserts get `visited = false` (D11). A hit
  only sets `visited = true` — the node is never spliced (no lazy-promotion move).
- Both `evict()` loops are bounded to `2 * capacity_ + 1` iterations: one full
  sweep can only clear bits, a second is always enough to find a genuine victim,
  and the bound still terminates correctly (returns `INVALID_PAGE`) if every
  resident page is pinned.

**Hand-computed test traces** (both verified by hand *before* running, then
matched the implementation on the first run — see the derivations in the
"Add hand-computed CLOCK/SIEVE tests" commit body and below):

- CLOCK, capacity 3, trace `1,2,3,4,2,5` → evictions `[1, 3]`. Pages 1-3 fill
  the three slots with `ref_bit=true`; requesting 4 forces a full sweep that
  clears all three bits without evicting, then a second pass evicts page 1
  (first slot revisited). Page 2's later hit refreshes its bit before the next
  eviction, so page 3 (never touched again) is evicted instead of it.
- SIEVE, capacity 3, trace `1,2,3,1,2,4,5,6,5,6,7` → evictions `[3, 1, 2, 4]`.
  Demonstrates lazy promotion (hits at positions 4-5 set visited bits without
  moving pages 1/2), the hand persisting *mid-sweep* across separate `evict()`
  calls (request 8 evicts immediately using the hand position left over from
  request 7), and quick demotion (page 4, inserted unprotected at request 6,
  is evicted three requests later, at request 11, having never been
  re-accessed again).
- Pin invariants (never evict a pinned page; report `INVALID_PAGE` when
  everything is pinned) now run against all four policies, not just FIFO/LRU.

**Verified:** `.\build.ps1` compiles with zero warnings, reports
`31 passed, 0 failed`.

**GitHub:** Phase 2 pushed as 4 commits (CLOCK, SIEVE, tests, this tracker
update), all authored solely as `sparshagra`.

## Phase 1 — what exists now

- `include/policies/fifo.h`, `include/policies/lru.h` — both header-only, both an
  index-linked doubly linked list over a `capacity_`-sized node array + `unordered_map`
  from page_id to node index (see D9). FIFO's `on_access` is a no-op; LRU's splices the
  hit node to the newest end.
- `src/buffer_pool.cpp` — `fetch_page`, `unpin_page`, `flush_all`, `find_victim_frame` are
  all real. Pin count and the policy's pinned flag are kept in sync on every pin/unpin.
- `tests/run_tests.cpp` — 23 assertions: original Phase 0 tests + hand-computed FIFO/LRU
  eviction traces (worked by hand in the commit messages) + pin invariants (pinned page
  never evicted; evict() returns `INVALID_PAGE` when everything is pinned) run against
  both policies.
- `bench/runner.cpp` — no longer uses the Phase 0 `NoopPolicy`; drives a real FIFO pool
  through 5 fetch/unpin calls on a 4-frame pool and confirms the correct page gets evicted.

**Verified:** `.\build.ps1` compiles both binaries with zero warnings and reports
`23 passed, 0 failed`; `.\build\runner.exe` confirms page 0 is evicted (FIFO, oldest) to
make room for page 4, and page 4 is resident afterward.

**GitHub:** repo created at `github.com/sparshagra/sieve-bufferpool` (public), Phase 0
scaffold + Phase 1 pushed as 9 commits total, all authored solely as `sparshagra`.

## Phase 0 — what exists now

```
sieve-bufferpool/
  README.md  PROJECT_TRACKER.md  CMakeLists.txt  build.ps1  .gitignore
  include/  policy.h  disk_manager.h  buffer_pool.h  policies/   (empty until Phase 1)
  src/      disk_manager.cpp (real)  buffer_pool.cpp (ctor real, methods stubbed)  policies/ (empty)
  bench/    runner.cpp   (stub main; Phase 4 makes it the real runner)
  tests/    run_tests.cpp (CHECK/CHECK_EQ macros + 15 assertions)
  results/  (generated: *.db, results.csv, PNGs, summary.md)
```

Interfaces frozen in Phase 0:
- `EvictionPolicy` — `on_access(pid)`, `on_insert(pid)`, `evict() -> page_id_t`,
  `name()`; plus concrete `set_pinned/is_pinned/capacity` in the base.
- `BufferPool` — `fetch_page(pid) -> char*` (pins), `unpin_page(pid, is_dirty)`,
  `flush_all()`, `stats()`, `is_resident(pid)`.
- `DiskManager` — `read_page/write_page` at `pid * 4096`, `num_reads/num_writes`,
  `set_io_enabled`.

**Verified:** both binaries compile with `-O2 -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` and **zero warnings**;
runner prints its config; tests report `15 passed, 0 failed`.

`NoopPolicy` is duplicated in `bench/runner.cpp` and `tests/run_tests.cpp` purely to exercise
virtual dispatch in Phase 0. **Phase 1 deletes both copies** once FIFO exists.

## How to resume in a fresh session

Read **only** this tracker plus the files of the current phase — do not read the whole repo.

- Phase 1 → `include/policy.h`, `include/buffer_pool.h`, `src/buffer_pool.cpp`, `tests/run_tests.cpp`
- Phase 2 → `include/policy.h`, `include/policies/lru.h` (as the pattern to follow), `tests/run_tests.cpp`
- Phase 3 → `include/policy.h`, `include/policies/sieve.h`, `tests/run_tests.cpp`
- Phase 4 → `include/buffer_pool.h`, `bench/runner.cpp`, all of `include/policies/`
- Phase 5 → `results/results.csv`, `results/summary.md`, `README.md`
- Phase 6 → everything, but for explaining rather than editing

Standing rules: one phase per response, then stop and wait for "continue". Every phase ends with
code that **compiles and whose tests pass — build and run them before reporting done**. Keep each
source file under ~150 lines. No `new`/`delete`, no smart pointers, no threads, no external deps.
Preallocate `std::vector`s and link nodes by **integer index** (`int prev, next; -1 = null`).
Update this tracker at the end of every phase.

Build + test in one command from the repo root:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
